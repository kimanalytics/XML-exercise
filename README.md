XML exercise with mondial database

Using data in 'data/mondial_database.xml' and refering to https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html, I find:

* 10 cities with the largest population
* 10 ethnic groups with the largest overall populations (sum of best/latest estimates over all countries)
* The name and country of: a) longest river, b) largest lake, and c) airport at highest elevation
